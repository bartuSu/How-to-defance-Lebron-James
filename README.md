# How to Defend Lebron James

## Project Overview

In this project I will analyze LeBron James' shooting statistics to determine the most effective way to defend against him.According to many high level Nba basketball players and even Lebron James himself Lebron James is unguardable.I have always wondered if my favorite basketball player, LeBron James, is actually unguardable or not.Therefore By examining shot locations, I will identify his most and least efficient shooting areas and use this data to propose data-driven defensive tactics.Are Lebron James and many Nba players right?.We will answer this question with datas.

## Data Sources

* NBA game data (shot location, shooting percentage, defender information, etc.).
* Sources:
* NBA Stats API
* Basketball Reference(web scraping)
* Kaggle NBA Datasets

## Analaysis Plan
### 1.Data Collection

* NBA Stats API: Retrieve LeBron James' game-by-game shot data, including shot locations, shooting percentages, and defender proximity.
* Basketball Reference:Player matchups, advanced shooting statistics, and historical game data are collected by using web scraping techniques
* Kaggle NBA Datasets: Use current datasets to get additional insights.
* Data cleaning and preprocessing: Remove unnecessary data, handle missing values, and format datasets for analysis.

### 2.Visualization

*Heat Maps: Visualizing LeBron's shot distribution for identifying his most and least efficetn shooting zones in basketball court.
*Boxplot Analysis: Identifying Lebron James's most and least efficient shooting zones by comparing the spread and variability of his shooting percentages across different areas on the court. This will help detect outliers and highlight areas where his shooting performance is inconsistent.

### 3.Statistical Analysis

* Regression Analaysis: Utilizing statistical modeling to comprehend the influence of defensive pressure, shot clock, and various contextual factors on LeBron’s shooting efficiency.
* Hypothesis Testing: Test hyphotesis H0:Defensive pressure have effect on LeBron’s shooting efficiency.
                                      Ha:Defensive pressure does not effect on Lebron's shooting efficiency.


### 4.Crate Defensive Strategy

* The best defensive tactics are determined by using data-driven insights.
* Measuring effectiveness of different defensive matchups and schemes against LeBron.

## Expected Outcomes

* Identification of LeBron's most and least effective shooting areas
* Find defensive strategies that opposing teams can use.
* Visualized shot maps and boxplot graphs.
* Statistical validation of defensive impact on LeBron's performance.
