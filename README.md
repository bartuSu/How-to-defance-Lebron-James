# How to Defend Lebron James

## Project Overview

In this project I will analyze LeBron James' shooting statistics to determine the most effective way to defend against him.According to many high level Nba basketball players and even Lebron James himself Lebron James is unguardable.I have always wondered if my favorite basketball player, LeBron James, is actually unguardable or not.Therefore By examining shot locations, I will identify his most and least efficient shooting areas and use this data to propose data-driven defensive tactics.Are Lebron James and many Nba players right?.We will answer this question with datas.

## Data Sources

* NBA game data (shot location, shooting percentage,etc.).
* Sources:
* Kaggle NBA Datasets

## Analaysis Plan
### 1.Data Collection
* Kaggle NBA Datasets: Use current datasets to get additional insights.
* Data cleaning and preprocessing: Remove unnecessary data, handle missing values, and format datasets for analysis.

### 2.Visualization

*Barplot Analysis: Visualizing LeBron's shot distribution for identifying his most and least efficetn shooting zones in basketball court.
*Boxplot Analysis: Identifying Lebron James's shoot choices in terms of distance by quartersThe boxplot is particularly useful in this case because it shows the spread of the data, highlighting the median, quartiles, and potential outliers for each quarter. This allows us to quickly observe how shot distances vary across different quarters, identify any trends, and detect any extreme values that might be worth investigating further
Correlation Matrix:Identifying correalation between Lebron James' successful shoots,distance and quarters 
*ScatterPlot Analysis: identifying potential trends or patterns related to shooting precision at different court positions.

### 3.Statistical Analysis

* Regression Analaysis: Utilizing statistical modeling to comprehend the influence of distance and horizontal positions  on LeBron’s shooting efficiency.
* Hypothesis Testing: Test hyphotesis H0:Distance have effect on LeBron’s shooting efficiency.
                                      Ha:Distance does not have effect on Lebron's shooting efficiency.
                                      H0:Horizontal position have effect on LeBron’s shooting efficiency
                                      Ha:Horizontal position does not have effect on LeBron’s shooting efficiency


### 4.Crate Defensive Strategy

* The best defensive tactics are determined by using data-driven insights.
* Measuring effectiveness of different defensive matchups and schemes against LeBron.

## Expected Outcomes

* Identification of LeBron's most and least effective shooting areas
* Find defensive strategies that opposing teams can use.
* Visualized shot maps and boxplot graphs.
*Statistical validation of the impact of quarters (remaining time) on LeBron James' shot selection and efficiency.
